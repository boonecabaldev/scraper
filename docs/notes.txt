the HatNodes image url is working

NodeLeafs
- only grabbing small image
- no url; clicking image pops slide show

in myspider.parse, for each HatNodeItem
    create a folder in /myspider/images with name equal to HatNodeItem.img_src filename (no file extension, in other words). create /myspider/images folder if it doesn't exist.
    download image file located at HatNodeItem.img_src and save it in folder just created

refactor this this code block  into a method called download_hatnodeimage

using url with format /photo.yupoo.com/newtrade6699/hat_cat_name/medium.jpg, i need to extract hat_cat_name
